# 🚀 Regression Model Containerized with Docker & Served via FastAPI

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates **containerizing a machine learning regression model** using **Docker** and deploying it through **FastAPI** for efficient and scalable serving.  
It was my **first hands-on experience with Docker**, and I successfully built, containerized, and ran the application seamlessly!
